              Few major projects worked on within the last 5 years. The
              relevancy of these works lies on the author's complete
              authenticity in terms of its end-to-end implementation; in other
              terms WYSIWYG. The mesh of the Project Management role combined
              with Software Engineering duties made consistent throughout most
              of the journey; even though one's not having accredited
              experience.
