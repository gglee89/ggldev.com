        <span>$ [What do I do]</span>I'm overseeing full application release
        cycles involving: TypeScript, React, Redux, Underscore/Lodash, Jest /
        Mocha / Jasmine / Sinon, Handlebars, Webpack, Node.js, MongoDB,
        DynamoDB, AWS S3, AWS ECS, AWS EKS, responsive, cross-browser
        compatibility, and mobile first approaches. I developed apps that works
        in the financial, management, entertainment, and healthcare industry
        mainly using the MERN stack and other minor extensions such as Lambda,
        API Gateway, AngularJS, WordPress, and SAP UI5. I love to create
        applications that bring real impact to users.
        <br />
        <span>$ [Code + Unit Testing === Good Quality Code]</span>I believe
        JavaScript unit testing is important and that adding quality controls to
        workflows (like ESLint & stylelint) helps teams learn/grow as well as
        helps to ensure that websites/apps work well across a myriad of browser,
        platforms, and devices.
        <br />
        <span>$ [DRY w/ Design Patterns]</span>I believe that applying design
        patterns and practices to the entire development stack and operational
        processes helps big teams working on large codebases to be able to
        secure, maintain and extend code.
        <br />
        <span>$ [Mentor]</span>I enjoy mentoring others, setting direction for
        best practices, digging into new tech, and exploring ways to make B2C
        applications with better UX.
